a major branch of numerical analysis is devoted to the development of efficient algorithms for matrix computations a subject that is centuries old and is today an expanding area of research matrix decomposition methods simplify computations both theoretically and practically algorithms that are tailored to particular matrix structures such as sparse matrices and neardiagonal matrices expedite computations in finite element method and other computations infinite matrices occur in planetary theory and in atomic theory a simple example of an infinite matrix is the matrix representing the derivative operator which acts on the taylor series of a function
